# DDBuffer

Provides a way to buffer Ruby enumerables/enumerators.

This is particularly useful when reading from a slow source and reading to a slow sink, because the two will be able to work concurrently. For example:

```ruby
# Read articles (an Enumerator)
articles = my_web_service.each_article

# Buffer 100 articles at a time
articles = DDBuffer.new(100).call(articles)

# Write buffered articles
articles.each_slice(50) do |slice|
  my_slow_db.insert_articles(slice)
end
```

## Usage

To install, add the `ddbuffer` gem to your Gemfile, and run `bundle`.

To buffer an enumerable `enum` with a buffer size of `size`:

```ruby
buffered_enum = DDBuffer.new(size).call(enum)
```

## Development

To run the tests:

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake
```
